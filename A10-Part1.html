    <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>When you visit a website, cookies—small text files stored on your device—are used to record information about your preferences and activities. For example, cookies can track the pages you visit, items you add to your shopping cart, or your login status, making your browsing experience more personalized and convenient. These cookies enable websites to remember your settings, such as language preferences, or to suggest products based on your past behavior. However, cookies can also record more detailed information, such as your location or browsing habits, which is often used for targeted advertising or analytics.</p>
    </br><h3>Pros & Cons of Cookies</h3>
      <p>The positive aspects of cookies include enhanced user convenience, as they eliminate the need to repeatedly enter information like usernames and preferences on frequently visited sites. Cookies also help businesses deliver tailored content, improving user experience and website efficiency. For example, they allow for personalized shopping recommendations or faster checkouts.</p>
      <p>However, there are negative aspects as well. Cookies can pose a privacy concern, especially when third-party tracking cookies monitor users across multiple websites without their explicit consent. This can lead to intrusive advertising and the potential misuse of personal data. Insecure storage or improper handling of cookies can also expose sensitive information to cyber threats.</p>
    </br><h3>Are Cookies Ethical?</h3>
      <p>The ethicality of cookies largely depends on how they are used and whether users are informed. If websites transparently explain their cookie policies and obtain informed consent, the practice can be ethical. However, when cookies are used to collect data without clear user knowledge or for deceptive purposes, such as profiling users without consent, it breaches ethical standards. Ultimately, the ethical use of cookies requires transparency, user control, and respect for privacy.</p>
